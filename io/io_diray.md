I kept trying to use dot noation. FOr example 

```io
names.foreach(n, items.append(n))
```

instead of

```io
    names foreach(n, items append(n))
```


Also, not using `()` for methods felt odd

SortedList toString := method(
    items foreach(i, writeln(i))
    items sort
)


I didn't know enjoy much of this laugneed.
